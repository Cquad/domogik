Packages overview

Purpose
=======

In Domgik world a package is a category of module. There are packages for Domogik but also packages for Domoweb (icons, themes for example).

Currently there is only one package type in Domogik: the xPL plugins, called as *plugins*.

In Domogik 0.4, the only way to install a package, :doc:`is a command line tool : the packages manager</enduser/packages/index>`. 

In the next releases, there will be, as it is in Domogik 0.3, a way to install and find packages over the administration web interface.
 
Packages and clients
====================

A package is just a group of files you can install on a Domogik system. When a package is installed on a Domogik server, it becomes a client : a client is a package instance on a server.

This is a very important thing to understand : a client is a package installed on a server, so you can have a package installed several times on a Domogik multi host system and all these installations are clients.
