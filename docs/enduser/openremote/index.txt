===================================
Openremote integration with Domogik
===================================

http://www.openremote.org is an open platform for easely creating user-interfaces.
From domogik 0.4 onwards we can interface domogik with openremote.

What do i need ?
================

* A working domogik installation
* A working openremote controller (Follow http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+Controller+Installation for installation instructions)
* An account on http://designer.openremote.org/

How do i interface with domogik ?
=================================

OpenRemote will interface with domogik via the Rest API, it will need a couple of commands:
* /sensor/<senorid>
* /cmd/<cmdid>?params

Openremote works with Commands, sensors and switches. For example to integrate a DT_Switch command in openremote you will need 3 openRemote commands:
* A read command
* A on command
* A off command

Creating an openremote command
==============================

Follow the `openRemote <http://openremote.org/display/docs/Designer+2.0+-+Create+New+Command>`_ command.

As protocol you select HTTP and then it will ask you some extra pramaters according to the `HTTP manual <http://openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+HTTP+Protocol>`_. Below is a list of what you need to fill in.

* URL:
    * for domogik sensors: <restURL>/sensor/<sensorID>. Ex: http://192.168.1.101:40405/sensor/9
    * for domogik commands: <restURL>/cmd/id/<cmdID>?<params>. Ex: http://192.168.1.101:40405/cmd/id/1?level=1
    * These urls can be found in the admin interface below each device
* HTTP Method: select GET
* Polling intervale (for domogik sensors only): 1s
* JSONPath Expression (for domogik sensors only): $.last_value

Examples
========

Creating a sensor in openremote
-------------------------------

What you will need:
* an openremote device
* an openremote command (to get the sensor value)
* an openremote sensor

Creating a switch in openremote
-------------------------------

For this example we will use a domogik sensor and a domogik command with DT_Switch.

What we need inside openremote:
* an openremote device
* three openremote commands:
    * an read command
    * an on command
    * an off command
* an openremote sensor
* an openremote switch
