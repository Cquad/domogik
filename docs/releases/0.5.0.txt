=============
Release 0.5.0
=============

Upgrades in the db
------------------

* The old not used table core_device_stats is deleted, same for the address field on a device. This finished the db upgrade we started in 0.4.x release.
* Close #96 : SQLAlchemy UTF-8 connection. This allow to use non latin languages with the butler (Russian for example)

Merge of Rest and Admin components
----------------------------------

Before 0.5 release, there were :

* an Admin component used to allow the user to do administrative tasks (packages configuration, devices creation, ...)
* a REST server which allows user interfaces, scripts, ... to do some actions on Domogik (get devices informations, create a new device, etc...)

To limit the memory footprint of Domogik, we choose to merge the both components as they are basically both web servers.

We choose to include REST services in the Admin component, so : 

* The REST service is now available on the same port as Domogik Administration (40406 per default).
* The REST service urls will all start with */rest/*. Example : */device/* become */rest/device/*.

This merge is a first step of a global performances improvment plan. Each release will include one improvment related to performances.

REST Api version is upgraded to 0.8 (previously : 0.7)

Install script upgrades
-----------------------

The install script has been improved to make the install process more simple.

* Some options that are not changed by most of the users are now hidden during the installation process. You still access them with the *--advanced* option or by editing the configuration file after the installation.

If you are wondering about how the network configuration is done, well the choice is automatically made for you by the installation script since the 0.4.2 release.
