========================
Core component : manager
========================

Purpose
=======

The manager component is installed on the main host of a Domogik system. It manages the clients list and details, start the clients (plugins installed on the hosts), ... On Domogik startup, the manager will try to start the other core components (excepting the administration user interfaces).


Packages discovery
==================

To find which clients are available on the host, the manager will check for the installed packages on startup, and then each N seconds. If a package in find in the packages installation folder, */var/lib/domogik/domogik_packages/* by default, the manager will check if this is a valid package and if so, it will add this package installed on the host to the clients list.
