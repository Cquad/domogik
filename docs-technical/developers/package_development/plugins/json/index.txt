============================
Plugin json file : info.json
============================

The **info.json** file is maybe the most important part of a plugin : it will describe the plugin, the configuration items and all interactions with xPL world. This file is divided in several sections: ::

    {
        "json_version": 2,
        "identity": {...},
        "configuration": [...],
        "commands": {...},
        "xpl_commands": {...},
        "sensors": {...},
        "xpl_stats": {...},
        "device_types": {...},
    }


The **json_version** must be set to **2** for Domogik 0.4 compliant plugins.

.. warning ::
   In json, you must write *\\n* each time you want to create a newline in the data.
