#Start domogik daemon under this user
DOMOGIK_USER=domogik

# This variable can take 6 parameters :
# -a to start the admin interface (launch only on master host)
# -d to start the database manager (launch only on master host)
# -x to start the xpl gw component (launch only on master host)
# -s to start the scenario manager component (launch only on master host)
# -b to start the butler component (launch only on master host)
# -a to start the admin interface (launch only on master host)

# Remember : Your domogik installation must have *one* and *only one*
# instance of each manager running.
# Your domogik installation won't start on this computer if :
#  - The database manager is not already running elsewhere on the network
#  - You do not pass -d parameter to the manager
MANAGER_PARAMS="-a -d -x -s -b"

# You may want to use a xPL hub which is not the one given with Domogik
# If so, set this option to 'false'
LAUNCH_DOMOGIK_XPL_HUB=true

# Two hubs are available in Domogik
# - the C hub 
# - the Domogik python hub
# By default, the Domogik python hub is used. On very slow computers, you may 
# want to use the C hub instead.
# Possible values are: c, python
DOMOGIK_XPL_HUB=python
