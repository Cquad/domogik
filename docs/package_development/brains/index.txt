Brain packages development
==========================

.. note::
    If you think something is not clear or is missing in this documentation, please send an email to our developpers mailing list : *domogik-developers@lists.labs.libre-entreprise.org* and explain us clearly what is not clear or what could be added.

General informations
====================

Some parts of this documentation will refer to the plugins development documentation as there are a lot of things in common : 

* the workflow
* the way to create a repository, to write the doc, to submit the package

Differences between a plugin and a brain package
================================================

A brain package is not something that is executed directly : the **butler** component will load each brain package it will find on the current host. 

A brain package does not need to create any device, so all the related informations in the json file will be empty.

A brain can contain several translations : you can find all the available languages in the **rs/** folder. Example : ::

    ./rs
    
    ./rs/nl_BE
    ./rs/nl_BE/DT_Temp.rive
    ./rs/nl_BE/...
    ./rs/nl_BE/DT_Humidity.rive
    
    ./rs/fr_FR
    ./rs/fr_FR/DT_Temp.rive
    ./rs/fr_FR/...
    ./rs/fr_FR/DT_Humidity.rive
    
    ./rs/en_US
    ./rs/en_US/DT_Temp.rive
    ./rs/en_US/...
    ./rs/en_US/DT_Humidity.rive

The RiveScript code is used as a basis. You can find more informations on the official website : http://www.rivescript.com/docs/tutorial

First, create a repository and write some specifications
========================================================

*See the plugin development documentation.*

Branches management
===================

*See the plugin development documentation.*

Brain package name
==================

There is no restriction in the length of the brain package name (for plugins, you have a 8 characters limitation due to xPL).

Prepare the plugin
==================

*See the plugin development documentation.*

Specific parts :

* :doc:`Brain package file tree <brain_file_tree/index>`

Before coding : branching to 'develop'
======================================

*See the plugin development documentation.*

Json file
=========

*See the plugin development documentation.*

To sum up, for a brain, you need only to fill 3 parts. You have to let the others empty :

* identity
* configuration
* json_version

Example: ::

    {
        "identity": {
            "author": "Fritz",
            "author_email": "fritz.smh at gmail.com",
            "tags": ["butler"],
            "dependencies": [],
            "description": "Butler package to use Wolfram Alpha",
            "domogik_min_version": "0.4.1",
            "name": "wolfram",
            "type": "brain",
            "version": "1.0"
        },
        "configuration": [
            {   
                "default": "",
                "description": "To get a Wolfram Alpha API key, you need to register (freely) on https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/signin.html",
                "key": "api_key",
                "name" : "Wolfram alpha API key",
                "required": true,
                "type": "string"
            }
        ],
        "products": [],
        "commands": {},
        "xpl_commands": {},
        "sensors": {},
        "xpl_stats": {},
        "device_types": {},
        "json_version": 2
    }


Rivescript part
===============

:doc:`Rules for writing the Rivescript part <rivescript>`

Python part
===========

Some brain parts may need a library file to interact with some internet services (for example). You can create a python library in the **lib/** folder.

See :doc:`the Rivescript rules for more informations <rivescript>`.
