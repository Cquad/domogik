I just installed Domogik... and now ?
=====================================

Assuming the installation process is ok and you started Domogik (if not, please go back to the installation documentation), you should now go in the Domogik administration user interface.

You should be able to access it on http://127.0.0.1:40406/ or http://x.x.x.x:40406/ depending on your configuration.

What can I do in the administration user interface ?
====================================================

Well, first, you should log in! The default credentials are : 

* user : admin
* password : 123

Then, you can access the clients list and the list of orphans devices. As you just installed Domogik, there are no clients (or maybe some external xPL clients) and no devices yet.

You can also change the *admin* user password. Please do it right now!
