=====================
Standard installation
=====================

If you are already a Domogik 0.3 user
=====================================

Domogik 0.4 database is really different from the 0.3 database. The process to migrate data from Domogik 0.3 to Domogik 0.4 is not fully guarantee yet. **Please do a backup of your domogik database before migrating from 0.3 to 0.4 !**.

**If you come from Domogik 0.3, you can directly install Domogik 0.4.1.**

If you encounter any issue during the database upgrade, please come on our irc channel and request us some help!


Installation
============

.. note::
    * Domogik includes its own xPL hub.  If you are running another xPL hub on your target machine (xpl-perl, etc), you will have to deactivate it before installation.
    * In this example, we use a *mysql* database. If you want to use a *postgresql* database, please refer to :doc:`the specific installations steps for postgresql <postgresql>`.

The sudo command
----------------

Some distributions may not include the **sudo** command as a default one. For Debian-based distribution, you can install it by doing as root : ::

    # apt-get install sudo

You can also simply logon as the **root** user and ignore the **sudo** part of the command for the commands that include a **sudo**.

Dependencies
------------

Check your Python version with the below command: ::

    python -V

.. note::
    Right now Domogik **requires Python 2.7**. Python 3 is not (yet) fully supported.

If you don't already have Python 2.7 or above (you have it if you are running a recent Linux system), please install the following package : 

* python2.7

.. note::
    Example on a Debian based distribution: ::

        $ sudo apt-get install python2.7
        $ sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python

Here are the needed dependencies. depanding on your Linux distribution, they will be installed autmatically Debian, Ubuntu) or not.

* the development packages, pip and setuptools : **python2.7-dev, python-pip, python-setuptools**
* SSL libraries : **libssl-dev**
* Zero MQ librariy : **libzmq-dev >= 14.4**. With the 14.3 release of this library, the publish/subscribe feature will not work!
* postgresql libraries : **libpq-dev, python-psycopg2**
* various needed libraries : **python-mako, libffi-dev**
* git : **git**
* MySQL server : **mysql-server**
* Sphinx and Sphinx theme : **python-sphinx, sphinx-better-theme**

.. note::
    * Even if you plan to use mysql database instead of postgresql, the *python-psycopg2* package is needed by the *alembic* library.

The **install.py** script will install these dependencies for the following distributions:

* Debian based distributions

For all the other distributions, please install them manually.

Mysql server
------------

.. note::
    * If you have already a Mysql server installed, you will only have to create the Domogik database.
    * Please note that Domogik does not automatically install the mysql server.
    * It is highly recommended to use the **innodb engine** (which can be enabled in /etc/mysql/my.cnf)

Install the packages for mysql server: ::

    $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Log on the mysql database as root user: ::

    $ mysql -u root -p
    Enter password: 

Create a database called *domogik* and add grants on it to the user *domogik*: ::

    CREATE DATABASE domogik;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON domogik.* to domogik@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'domopass';


Download Domogik components
---------------------------

.. note::
    The following commands assume that you are using the **/opt/dmg/** folder as the root folder for Domogik. And so Domogik will be installed in the */opt/dmg/domogik/* folder.
    If you choose another folder, please keep in mind the below points:

    * You must put Domogik sources in a folder which can be read by all the system users and the domogik user. For example, be carefull if you extract domogik sources in */home/john/domogik* and you choose the *domogik* user during installation : the *domogik* user must have write access to */home/john/domogik*.
    * Don't download Domogik sources directly in */root* or */*
    * The folder path must also not contains any spaces in its name!



Two components are needed to install domogik : 

* **domogik-mq** : the message queue component used by all components which want/need to use the message queue (Domogik, Domoweb, ...)
* **domogik**

Git is used to get the sources (be sure that your user is able to create some directories where you will clone the sources).


Create the folder */opt/dmg/* : ::

    $ sudo mkdir -p /opt/dmg
    $ sudo useradd -M domogik
    $ sudo chown domogik /opt/dmg  # assuming the user domogik already exists!

    [ Installing or upgrading the db ]
    ==> Creating backup
    Do you want to backup your database? [Y/n]

If you are upgrading your Domogik, you should let the installer do a backup of your database! ::

    Backup file? [/tmp/domogik-1442999380.sql] 

Set the backup file

.. note::

    * Domogik uses a configuration file which is created and configured by the *install.py* script. This file is */etc/domogik/domogik.cfg*. For more informations, please read :doc:`the page related to the configuration file <domogik_cfg_file>`.
    * If you want to use the C xPL hub instead of the python xPL hub, you need to update manually the configuration after Domogik installation. See :doc:`here </xplhub/index>` for more informations on the xpl hub.



In case you keep your old Domogik 0.4.0 configuration file **/etc/domogik/domogik.cfg**, you will have to complete it with these lines for Domoik 0.4.1 : ::

    [butler]
    name = Aria
    lang = fr_FR
    sex = female
    
    [backup]
    folder = /opt/dmg/backup

Butler section : 

* The **name** is your butler name, use the name you want.
* The **lang** is your language : fr_FR, en_US, ...
* The **sex** is related to the name you choosed : male, female

Backup section : 

* The **folder** location is the place in which all domogik data will be backuped (database, configuration files, etc).


Make Domogik start with your computer
-------------------------------------

For Debian or Ubuntu systems: ::

    $ sudo update-rc.d domogik defaults

Start domogik
-------------

::

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/domogik start
    * Starting 0MQ broker ... Done.
    * Starting 0MQ forwarder ... Done.
    * Starting xPL (python version)... Done.
    * Starting Manager (with -d -r -x -s)... Done.
    * Starting the admin interface ... Done.

It will start : 

* The 0MQ broker and forwarder
* The xpl hub
* The Domogik manager on this host
* The database manager and the REST interface module (which will take in account the parameters you defined in your configuration file : host, IP...)
* The administration web interface

.. note::
    Default **login** and **password** are : 

    * login : admin
    * password : 123

Set up the automatic backup
---------------------------

If you want (and you should), you could configure a daily (or weekly) backup. Domogik provides a python backup script : **backup.py**. 

To use it, edit your crontab file: ::

    crontab -e

And add at the end the below lines: ::

    # Domogik backup each night at 1:00
    0 1 * * * /opt/dmg/domogik/backup.py > /var/log/domogik/backup-$(date "+\%Y\%m\%d_\%H\%M").log 2>&1
    # Domogik : regenerate packages documentation each hour
    0 * * * * /opt/dmg/domogik/src/domogik/bin/package.py >> /var/log/domogik/refresh_docs_pkg-$(date "+\%Y\%m\%d").log 2>&1

The default backup folder is **/var/lib/domogik/backup/**. You can change it in the file **/etc/domogik/domogik.cfg** in the section **[backup]**. Example: ::

    ###
    # Backup configuration
    ###
    [backup]
    folder=/var/lib/domogik/backup/



Next step : domoweb, the web user interface
-------------------------------------------

Check in the Domoweb documentation.
