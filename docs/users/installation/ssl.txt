Activate ssl for admin and REST
===============================

Activating ssl is a good idea for the security. But, without a valid certificate (:doc:`more informations here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority>`), your browser may display a message that warn you about security when you are trying to access Domogik administration.

The instructions on this page will install a personnal certificate which will not be valid. But it will still add more security!

Don't forget to **upgrade your Domoweb or Domodroid configuration if you activate the ssl**.

Basic activation
----------------

Just execute the **ssl_activate.sh** script and restart domogik to use ssl.

Advanced activation tutorials
-----------------------------

Generate the certificate
************************

Tou will need to generate 2 files, the self signed certificate and the key file:

First we need to generate the key file **without a paraphrase**: ::

    $ openssl genrsa -des3 -out <hostname>.key 1024

You should now have a <hostname>.key file.

The second file is the certificate itself, this is generated in 2 steps:

1- generating the Certificate Signing Request: ::

    $ openssl req -new -key <hostname>.key -out <hostname>.csr

2- the self signed certificate: ::

    $ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in <hostname>.csr -signkey <hostname>.key -out <hostname>.crt

If you followed the above steps you will have the 2 needed files, <hostname>.key and <hostname>.crt

Configure REST
**************

To configure rest to use ssl we need to adapt the /etc/domogik/domogik.cfg file, there are 3 important keys for this

* use_ssl = True
* ssl_certificate = should point to the .crt file
* ssl_key = should point to the .key file

One this is updated restart domogik, and rest should be running with ssl enabled.

Restart the REST server.

Upgrade Domoweb configuration
-----------------------------

Just replace the **rest_url** parameter. For example, ::

    rest_url = 'http://192.168.1.50:40406/rest'

Will become : ::

    rest_url = 'https://192.168.1.50:40406/rest'
