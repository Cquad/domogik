Terms to know before using Domogik
==================================

.. glossary::

    RTFM
        *Read the fucking manual*. Don't forget to search the information in the doc before asking ;). There are a lot of informations in the documentation. But of course if you don't find the information, we will help you!

    Domogik
        It is the core part of the Domogik automation system. Domogik is made of core components, a xPL hub, a message queue and a database. Domogik has no control user interface included : only an administration web interface is provided.

    User interface
        There are several user interfaces available for Domogik. 

    xPL
        xPL is an open protocol intended to permit the control and monitoring of home automation devices.

    xPL hub
        A xPL hub is a software hub which is used to handle xPL flows.

    Message queue
        Messages queues provide an asynchronous communication protocol. This is used by Domogik components to discuss together.

    Core component
        Domogik core components are the heart of Domogik, they have no automation features but they are needed to make all automation plugins to interact together.
    
    Package
        A package is a group of files with a type (plugin, widget, icon, ...), a name and a version. Example : *plugin zwave 0.1*. Depending on the type, it will add features to Domogik or a user interface (Domoweb).

    Plugin
        This is a type of packages. Plugins are packages for Domogik. A plugin will handle one technology, one hardware gateway or some online services. A plugin is in fact a *xPL plugin* : than means that a plugin will send the events or the sensors values over xPL and will wait for xPL commands.

    Client
        A client is a package instance. For example, a plugin installed on a server is a client. The same plugin installed on another server is another client.

    Device
        A device is a reference to a hardware, software or online service element. A device is related to a device type. A device is linked to a client. If the client is uninstalled or disappear (is this is some external xPL device for example), the device will become orphan.

    Device type
        A plugin will allow to create various kind of devices (for example a temperature sensor or a temperature and humidity sensor). A kind of device is a device type. A device type can have several features. 

    Device feature
        A device feature can be a sensor or a command. Each device feature can have its own parameters (address, polling interval, ...).

    Sensor
        A sensor is something that read or catch some values (temperature, humidity, light status, ...)

    Command
        A command is something that do an action (switch on the light, ...)
