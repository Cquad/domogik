How to release a Domogik version
================================

.. todo::
    To finish

Summary
=======

There are two main branches in Domogik/Domoweb/Domodroid sources :

* **master** : this is the branch which contains the last stable release.
* **develop** : this branch contains the upgrades that are finished and will be included in the next stable delivery.

Each release is a **tag** created from the **develop** branch. When the tag is about a *final* release (not a alpha/beta/candidate), this tag will be merged in the **master** branch.

Each improvment or fix on Domogik/Domoweb/Domodroid must be implemented in a dedicated branch! The dedicated branch can be merged into **develop** only when developments are finished, documentation is up to date and all tests are passing.

We basically follow the main lines of this `git branching model <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_

Before releasing
================

* Do some database migration tests
  * run a previous release fresh install and backup this database (empty)
  * load the backup, run the install, do a mysqldump -d to get only the structure and store it in xx_to_yy.sql file
  * drop the database, run the install, do a mysqldump -d and store it in yy.sql file
  * do a diff between xx_to_yy.sql and yy.sql, they must be the same !
* Check **Release note is ok**
* Check website is ready
* Check countdown website is ready
* Check installation doc is up to date for Domogik, Domoweb
* Do we need a new MQ release ?


Releasing - step 1 - prepare the packages
=========================================

List of packages that could be upgraded in the release:

* domogik
* domoweb
* domogik-mq
* domodroid
* Andorid butler application

Release domogik-mq if needed
----------------------------

If the Domogik release need a new version of Domogik-mq to work, create this one :

* create a tag in the **develop** branch
* merge the tag in the **master** branch
* update if needed the README.md in master to make all reference on master and not develop
* go on GitHub and create a release from the tag.

*For the details of the command, you can use the same commands as for Domogik*.

Release a beta
--------------

In the **develop** branch, make sure you merged all needed features branches :

::

    git checkout develop
    git merge my_feature_A
    git merge my_feature_B

For a few days, do some tests with the develop branches on the included features.

When all is ok, put a tag on the develop branch. for example for a beta release:

::

    git tag -a "0.4.0b1" -m "Release 0.4.0 beta 1"

Go on GitHub and create a release from the tag.


Release a final release
-----------------------

..todo ::
    complete
    * update if needed the README.md in master to make all reference on master and not develop

Create the release branch :

..todo ::
    complete

In the newly created release branch, upgrade the install documentation with the final packages (tgz) from the GitHub for all needed components (domogik, domogik-mq)


Releasing - step 2 - prepare resources
======================================

Here are the resources related to a version :

* documentation
* website

Documentation
-------------

* Upgrade the doc header template in domogik sources (layout.html in _theme/domogiksite)
* Upgrade the doc index on the VM (static_index/index.tpl)
* Upgrade the docs.domogik.org/domogik|web shortcuts on the VM if neded in /etc/nginx/...
* Rebuild all docs to include new header


Website
-------

* If available put the countdown page
* Set up the new website


Prepare the next release
========================

Each improvment must be developed in a dieicated branch. For the example, let's call this branch **wip** (work in progress).

When the **wip** branch is ready (development finished and tested, documentation, written), the branch can be mergerd in the **develop** branch to be included in the next stable release. Here are the steps to follow : 

* in your **wip** branch, do a ``git merge develop`` to merge **develop** in **wip**. Then, do some tests in your **wip** branch to check if all is still ok. 
* go on the **develop** branch : ``git checkout develop`` and do the merge from **wip** into **develop** : ``git merge wip``. Do again some tests to see if all is ok.
* in the **develop** branch, go in the **docs/releases/** folder and create or fill the next release related file to tell what will be included in the release.
