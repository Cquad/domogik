Rivescript rules
================


Weight
======

In rivescript, the default weight is set to 1. But the rivescript included in Domogik is patched to use a default weight of 10.

If you plan to use weight in your scripts, don't forget about this!


Special characters
==================

All the below characters are replaced by spaces before processing : ?!.,

The "-" character is not replaced as it can be used for mathematic usages. If you have a trigger that may contain a "-" in it, please handle it with "[-]"

People mistakes
===============

People make sadly a lot of mistakes, especially when writing... In the rules, you may try to take the most common mistakes in account.
