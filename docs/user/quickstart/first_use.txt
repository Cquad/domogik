First use
=========

I just installed Domogik... and now ?
=====================================

Assuming the installation process is ok and you started Domogik (if not, please go back to the installation documentation), you should now go in the Domogik administration user interface.

You should be able to access it on http://127.0.0.1:40406/ or http://x.x.x.x:40406/ depending on your configuration.

What can I do in the administration user interface ?
====================================================

Well, first, you should log in! The default credentials are : 

* user : admin
* password : 123

Please don't forget to change the password for security reasons!

.. todo : explain how ot change the password

Then, you can access the clients list. As you just installed Domogik, there is no client and no device yet.

You can now :doc:`install a package <install_a_package>`
