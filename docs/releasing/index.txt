How to release a Domogik version
================================

.. todo::
    To finish

Summary
=======

There are two main branches in Domogik/Domoweb/Domodroid sources :

* **master** : this is the branch which contains the last stable release.
* **develop** : this branch contains the upgrades that are finished and will be included in the next stable delivery.

Each release is a **tag** created from the **develop** branch. When the tag is about a *final* release (not a alpha/beta/candidate), this tag will be merged in the **master** branch.

Each improvment or fix on Domogik/Domoweb/Domodroid must be implemented in a dedicated branch! The dedicated branch can be merged into **develop** only when developments are finished, documentation is up to date and all tests are passing.

We basically follow the main lines of this `git branching model <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_

Releasing
=========

Release domogik-mq if needed
----------------------------

If the Domogik release need a new version of Domogik-mq to work, create this one :

* create a tag in the **develop** branch
* merge the tag in the **master** branch
* go on GitHub and create a release from the tag.

*For the details of the command, you can use the same commands as for Domogik*.

Release a beta
--------------

In the **develop** branch, make sure you merged all needed features branches :

::

    git checkout develop
    git merge my_feature_A
    git merge my_feature_B

For a few days, do some tests with the develop branches on the included features.

When all is ok, put a tag on the develop branch. for example for a beta release:

::

    git tag -a "0.4.0b1" -m "Release 0.4.0 beta 1"

Go on GitHub and create a release from the tag.


Release a final release
-----------------------

..todo ::
    complete

Create the release branch :

..todo ::
    complete

In the newly created release branch, upgrade the install documentation with the final packages (tgz) from the GitHub for all needed components (domogik, domogik-mq)
