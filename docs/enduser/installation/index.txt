=====================
Standard installation
=====================

If you are already a Domogik 0.3 user
=====================================

Domogik 0.4 database is really different from the 0.3 database. The process to migrate data from Domogik 0.3 to Domogik 0.4 is not fully guarantee yet. **Please do a backup of your domogik database before migrating from 0.3 to 0.4 !**.

**If you come from Domogik 0.3, before installing Domogik 0.4.1 you must install Domogik 0.4.0 for the database upgrade process!**


Installation
============

.. note::
    * Domogik includes its own xPL hub.  If you are running another xPL hub on your target machine (xpl-perl, etc), you will have to deactivate it before installation.
    * In this example, we use a *mysql* database. If you want to use a *postgresql* database, please refer to :doc:`the specific installations steps for postgresql <postgresql>`.

Dependencies
------------

Check your Python version with the below command: ::

    python -V

.. note::
    Right now Domogik **requires Python 2.7**. Python 3 is not (yet) fully supported.

If you don't already have Python 2.7 or above (you have it if you are running a recent Linux system), please install the following package : 

* python2.7

.. note::
    Example on a Debian based distribution: ::

        $ sudo apt-get install python2.7
        $ sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python

Here are the needed dependencies. depanding on your Linux distribution, they will be installed autmatically Debian, Ubuntu) or not.

* the development packages, pip and setuptools : **python2.7-dev, python-pip, python-setuptools**
* SSL libraries : **libssl-dev**
* Zero MQ librariy : **libzmq-dev**
* postgresql libraries : **libpq-dev, python-psycopg2**
* various needed libraries : **python-mako, libffi-dev**
* git : **git**
* MySQL server : **mysql-server**

.. note::
    * Even if you plan to use mysql database instead of postgresql, the *python-psycopg2* package is needed by the *alembic* library.

The **install.py** script will install these dependencies of the following distributions:

* Debian based distributions

For all other distributions, please install them manually.

Mysql server
------------

.. note::
    * If you have already a Mysql server installed, you will only have to create the Domogik database.
    * Please note that Domogik does not automatically install the mysql server.
    * It is highly recommended to use the **innodb engine** (which can be enabled in /etc/mysql/my.cnf)

Install the packages for mysql server: ::

    $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Log on the mysql database as root user: ::

    $ mysql -u root -p
    Enter password: 

Create a database called *domogik* and add grants on it to the user *domogik*: ::

    CREATE DATABASE domogik;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON domogik.* to domogik@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'domopass';


Download Domogik components
---------------------------

.. note::
    The following commands assume that you are using the **/opt/dmg/** folder as the root folder for Domogik. And so Domogik will be installed in the */opt/dmg/domogik/* folder.
    If you choose another folder, please keep in mind the below points:

    * You must put Domogik sources in a folder which can be read by all the system users and the domogik user. For example, be carefull if you extract domogik sources in */home/john/domogik* and you choose the *domogik* user during installation : the *domogik* user must have write access to */home/john/domogik*.
    * Don't download Domogik sources directly in */root* or */*
    * The folder path must also not contains any spaces in its name!



Two components are needed to install domogik : 

* **domogik-mq** : the message queue component used by all components which want/need to use the message queue (Domogik, Domoweb, ...)
* **domogik**

Git is used to get the sources (be sure that your user is able to create some directories where you will clone the sources).


Create the folder */opt/dmg/* : ::

    $ sudo mkdir -p /opt/dmg
    $ sudo useradd -M domogik
    $ sudo chown domogik /opt/dmg  # assuming the user domogik already exists!


Download the sources on GitHub
******************************

Download Domogik-mq : ::

    $ cd /opt/dmg/
    $ git clone https://github.com/domogik/domogik-mq.git
    $ cd domogik-mq
    $ git checkout develop

Download Domogik : ::

    $ cd /opt/dmg/
    $ git clone https://github.com/domogik/domogik.git
    $ cd domogik
    $ git checkout develop

Install Domogik-mq
------------------

::

    $ cd /opt/dmg/domogik-mq
    $ sudo ./install.py


.. todo::

    Explain:

    * key ip
        
.. note::

    Focus on some options :

    * *Install MQ as master (lib+daemon) or client (lib only) ? [M/s]*

      On on single server installation, choose the default option (library and daemon). On a multi server installation (not yet ready in 0.4), on the main server, choose the default option and on the other servers, choose the client option.

Install Domogik 
---------------

Since Domogik 0.4, there is no more *install.sh* file. Now you must use the *install.py*: ::

    $ cd /opt/dmg/domogik/
    $ sudo ./install.py --dist-packages

.. note::

    * Domogik uses a configuration file which is created and configured by the *install.py* script. This file is */etc/domogik/domogik.cfg*. For more informations, please read :doc:`the page related to the configuration file <domogik_cfg_file>`.
    * During the installation, a new user will be created if necessary.
    * If you want to use the C xPL hub instead of the python xPL hub, you need to update manually the configuration after Domogik installation. See :doc:`here </xplhub/index>` for more informations on the xpl hub.

.. todo::
    Describe all the steps

In case you keep your old Domogik 0.4.0 configuration file **/etc/domogik/domogik.cfg**, you will have to complete it with these lines: ::

    [butler]
    name = Aria
    lang = fr_FR
    sex = female

The **name** is your butler name, use the name you want.
The **lang** is your language : fr_FR, en_US, ...
The **sex** is related to the name you choosed : male, female


Make Domogik start with your computer
-------------------------------------

For Debian or Ubuntu systems: ::

    $ sudo update-rc.d domogik defaults

Start domogik
-------------

::

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/domogik start
    * Starting 0MQ broker ... Done.
    * Starting 0MQ forwarder ... Done.
    * Starting xPL (python version)... Done.
    * Starting Manager (with -d -r -x -s)... Done.
    * Starting the admin interface ... Done.

It will start : 

* The 0MQ broker and forwarder
* The xpl hub
* The Domogik manager on this host
* The database manager and the REST interface module (which will take in account the parameters you defined in your configuration file : host, IP...)
* The administration web interface

Next step : domoweb, the web user interface
-------------------------------------------

Check in the Domoweb documentation.

It doesn't work?
