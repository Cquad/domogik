Upgrades in the db
------------------

* The old not used table core_device_stats is deleted, same for the address field on a device. This finished the db upgrade we started in 0.4.x release.
* Close #96 : SQLAlchemy UTF-8 connection. This allow to use non latin languages with the butler (Russian for example)
