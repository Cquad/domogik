=======================================
What should contain the documentation ?
=======================================

The documentation is very important! If there is no documentation for your plugin or if the documentation is not clear, the users won't want to use your plugin.

A structured documentation
==========================

Your documentation must be logic and structured. It should follow some logical steps: 

* first, describe the plugin, what is its goal, what are its features
* then, don't forget to list the compliant hardware devices or services 
* add some photos of the hardware in order the user can be sure he has the same thing
* if there are some complex dependancies (like OWFS for *onewire*), explain how to install them or at least give url to the appropriate documentations
* explain how to configure the plugin (the global configuration, not the domogik devices configuration)
* explain how to create a device (not where the user should click on the user interface as there is already a documentation for this) : 

  * which feature it used for which hardware device or service ?
  * what does a device address will look like
  * give sample values and explain them

* if your plugin has some helpers, explain their features and how to use them
* finally you may add any informations that seem important for the user
