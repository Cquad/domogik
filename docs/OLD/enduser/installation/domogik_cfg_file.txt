=====================================================
Domogik configuration file : /etc/domogik/domogik.cfg
=====================================================

Purpose
=======

The Domogik configuration file is created when the *install.py* script is launched. For each key of this file, an option is available for the *install.py* script (this is managed dynamically, so each update on the template configuration file will available from the *install.py* script without needing to modify this one).


Template
========

The template is located in *src/domogik/examples/config/domogik.cfg.sample*. It contains the default values and comments to describe all the keys. Please check this file for more informations about the way to configure it!

During the installation, this file is also copied as */etc/domogik/domogik.cfg.sample*.

domogik.cfg
===========

The domogik.cfg file does not contain any comments as it is generated from the sample file during the installation.
