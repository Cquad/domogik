==================
Domogik data types
==================

Purpose
=======

Domogik data type are used to define the availables values for a device type.


Where can I find the list of the data types ?
=============================================

The data types allowed by Domogik are defined in the file *src/domogik/common/datatypes.json* in the sources. Here is for example `the content of the file for the *master* branch <https://github.com/domogik/domogik/blob/master/src/domogik/common/datatypes.json>`_

How to choose a data type ?
===========================

If the device can be used for various use cases, you should choose a parent type, for example *DT_Bool* for a True/False usage. If the device is specific to an usage, you can use a child type, for example, instead of *DT_Bool*, use *DT_Switch* for a light, *DT_OpenClose* for a door sensor.

Notice about widgets
====================

A widget should handle both the parent and child type to be compliant with most of the plugins : an on/off light widget would handle both *DT_Bool* and *DT_Switch*.
