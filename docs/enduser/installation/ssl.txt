Activate ssl for REST
=====================

Generate the certificate 
------------------------

Tou will need to generate 2 files, the self signed certificate and the key file:

First we need to generate the key file: ::
    
    $ openssl genrsa -des3 -out <hostname> 1024
    
You should now have a <hostname>.key file.

The second file is the certificate itself, this is generated in 2 steps:

1- generating the Certificate Signing Request: ::

    $ openssl req -new -key <hostname>.key -out <hostname>.csr
    
2- the self signed certificate: ::

    $ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in <hostname>.csr -signkey <hostname>.key -out <hostname>.crt
    
If you followed the above steps you will have the 2 needed files, <hostname>.key and <hostname>.crt

Configure REST
--------------

To configure rest to use ssl we need to adapt the /etc/domogik/domogik.cfg file, there are 2 important keys for this

* ssl_certificate = should point to the .crt file
* ssl_key = should point to the .key file
    
One this is updated restart domogik, and rest should be running with ssl enabled.
    

Restart the REST server.
