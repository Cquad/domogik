==================
Documentation tree
==================

Depending on the plugin, the documentation may be very big (this is the case for the plugin *ozwave* for example) or very small (this is the case for the plugin *diskfree* for example). So you won't create your documentation in the same way for all the plugins. In this chapter, we will give you only rules and recommendations.

The mandatory part
==================

Only 3 files are mandatory:

* docs/index.txt
* docs/myplugin.txt : replace *myplugin* by your plugin name : *diskfree*, *ozwave*, ...
* docs/changelog.txt
* docs/dev.txt

The **index.txt** file will be the toctree of your documentation. It will contain only references to all the other files. 

The **myplugin.txt** file is the main file for your plugin documentation. It will contain informations about plugin configuration, devices creation, ...

The **changelog.txt** file will contain the history of your package. 

The **dev.txt** will contain some technical informations for the developers.

Example tree for a simple plugin
================================

For a plugin named *myplugin*: ::

    docs/index.txt
    docs/myplugin.txt
    docs/dev.txt
    docs/changelog.txt
    docs/*.png

For these plugins all the content of the user documentation will be directly written in *myplugin.txt*.

Example tree for a big plugin
=============================

::

    docs/index.txt
    docs/mybigplugin.txt
    docs/aspecialpage.txt
    docs/anotherspecialpage.txt
    docs/dev.txt
    docs/changelog.txt
    docs/*.png

Of course you can use sub directories if you need.

Focus on index.txt
==================

The **index.txt** file is very important! It must contain a link to all other txt files. Example: ::

    .. _toc:
    
    ================
    Table Of Content
    ================
    
    .. toctree::
    
        /myplugin
        /dev
        /changelog
