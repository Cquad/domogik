Plugin specifications
=====================

For any development project, the developer (ideally not the developer, but for Domogik plugins, it will be the developer for most of the plugins), must write some specifications.

People often think that specifications takes too much time and it is an optional step. Yes, you can skip the specifications step, but there is a risk you loose a lot of time when doing this ;).

For Domogik plugins we strongly suggest you to write some specifications before doing anything. Here are some things you should focus on: 

* plugin features
* xpl messages that will be used (you should read http://xplproject.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=XPL_Message_Schema)
* how to handle errors (access to the hardware or service, ...) 
* does the plugin need dedicated configuration pages on Domoweb administration interface ?

As GitHub already integrates a wiki component for each repository, you should use the plugin repository wiki to write the specifications.

You may also want to define a roadmap in this wiki if you plan to do the plugin in several steps.
