===================
The brain file tree
===================

The brain file tree will at least contains (assuming the brain name is *mybrain*):

* **__init__.py** : an empty file needed by python
* **info.json** : the json file which describe the brain and its features. This file must always be named like this!
* **rs/<lang>/*.rive** : the rivescript files

* **doc/** : the sphynx documentation in ReST format
* **design/** : this folder will contain all graphical resources (icons, ...)

  * **design/icon.png** : the brain icon (png, 96px * 96px). This file must always be named like this!

Some other items may be added: 

* **data** : if needed this folder can contain data needed by the brain or the brain may write data in it
* **tests** : if the brain have some tests scripts, they must be here
* **lib/** : the python libraries
  
  * **lib/__init__.py** : an empty file needed by python
  * **lib/mybrain.py** : the python library part
