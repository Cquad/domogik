===================================
Upgrading from Domogik 0.3 to 0.4.x
===================================


Warning
=======

There is a big gap between the releases 0.3 and 0.4 for several reasons:

* The plugins format has been upgraded.
* The database model and the way to handle devices and their features has totally changed.
* The administration interface has moved from Domoweb to Domogik (on port 40406 by default).
* ...

For more informations, please check the :doc:`0.4.0 release page <../../releases/0.4.0>` and the :doc:`0.4.1 release page <../../releases/0.4.1>`

Before starting to upgrade from 0.3 to 0.4, please notice that:

* **0.3 or 0.2 plugins are not compliant with Domogik 0.4 and most of them are not yet converted to the new format** : you may be able to not use all of your technologies yet.
* **as the database model has been changed, all the existing devices will be unusable, but there is a way to recover their history and so to keep the data** : keep in mind that some bugs can occurs so please, do a database backup before the installation!
* **you can't upgrade from 0.2 to 0.4 : you will need to install the 0.3 release first**.

Steps to upgrade
================

Installation
------------

First, install Domogik 0.4.1. Then install the needed plugins. Create the devices with the plugins in the same way you did in 0.3.0.

Now you can start recovery

Recover your 0.3 devices history
--------------------------------

To upgrade your device you first need to create the new (the 0.4 formatted) device, so follow the doc on how to create a device.

The next step is to run the statsUpgrade.py script in the domogik root folder. This script will handle the uprgade for you,
it asks a couple of questions about what device to upgrade and where to upgrade to.

The steps taken (by the script):
* Ask the old device to upgrade
* Ask the old stats key to upgrade
* Request the new device
* Request the sensor to transfer the stats to
* Do it

In the last step you will need to enter 'YES I AM SURE' and once this is entered the uprgade will happen for the select old device and stats key.
This means that you have to do this for each device and stats key you want to upgrade.
