Plugins technical documentation

Overview
========

Plugins developers don't need to read this page to be able to develop some plugins. This page is mainly for core developers to understand internal features of the plugins.


Plugins status
==============

During its life, a plugin will get various status.  All these status are available:

* STATUS_STARTING : the client is started but not yet ready (waiting for configuration or still doing some init stuff)
* STATUS_NOT_CONFIGURED : the client is not configured and so can't be started
* STATUS_ALIVE : the client is ready for use
* STATUS_STO_REQUEST : the client has been requested to stop itself
* STATUS_STOPPED : the client as been stopped in the appropriate way
* STATUS_DEAD : the client has disappeared
* STATUS_UKNOWN : the client is in an unknown status (client detected but status not set to anything : for a plugin it may be a syntax error)
* STATUS_INVALID : the client is invalid (for a plugin, this may be an invalid json file)

To get the associated values, please check in Domogik sources : *src/domogik/xpl/common/plugin.py*
